            <h1>Mardi Gras</h1>
            <p>Most of the Central Business District and French Quarter hotels require a four to five day minimum stay, and they steadily book blocks of rooms beginning in August. Make your reservations now!</p>
            <p>
                Hotels are often solidly booked by December, so reserve ahead of time. Check out recommended hotels close to the action or Mardi Gras packages. If they are sold out, we also recommend the hotels that are listed on BestNewOrleansHotels.com.
            </p>
            <p>

                Okay, so it's January, and you decide you want to visit New Orleans on Fat Tuesday. Should you even try? Yes! It is worth it, but just be prepared to spend a lot of time on the phone. Keep calling. Hotels have cancellations, and there are waiting lists. If you are persistent, you just may find a place somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                And remember, the parades and festivities start well before Fat Tuesday! Hotels often have rooms available when the parades first begin. This is a great time to visit New Orleans if you want to see some parades and get a great Mardi Gras experience without all the crowds.
            </p>

            <h2>Don't wait until January to start planning your trip</h2>

            <p>
                Yes, we touched on this in the tip above, but it's so important that it bears repeating. Waiting to make reservations usually isn't a good idea if you have definitely decided to enjoy Mardi Gras in New Orleans. 
            </p>
                
            <p>You might get lucky, but there is no guarantee. If you like to gamble and don't want to reserve the minimum night stay required at most hotels, then you can wait and see if those hotels will relax their minimum night stay requirements if they have rooms that need to be filled. But there is no guarantee this will happen. You definitely don't want to come to New Orleans looking for a room.</p>

            <h2>Get there early</h2>

            <p>
                Parade routes can look empty, but the crowd size can swell fast within an hour or two of the parade, making that front-row spot four or five people deep. For the biggest parades rolling in the evenings on the weekend before Mardi Gras, plan to get there about four hours ahead of time to get yourself a great spot.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the Sunday night Bacchus Parade, we're at our spot (drum roll here) at 6:00 a.m. You can find us on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon Avenue, near the beginning of the parade. We sit wrapped up in a blanket, and enjoy people-watching. That Sunday, several afternoon parades also roll by as the crowds swell for one of the biggest parades of the season - Bacchus. I save the spot until my family shows up, so they can make another area parade taking place in Mid-City. All of this for a parade scheduled to roll at 6:00 p.m.
